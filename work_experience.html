                    I became an entrepreneur in early spring of 2022. You can read more on that <a href="entrepreneurship">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been working the summers for 5 years now as a property maintenance worker in Eurajoki, Pori and Espoo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was employed by Eurajoen kiinteistöpalvelu Oy for the summers 2017, 2018 and 2019. During years of 2020 and 2021 I worked in Porin kiinteistöpalvelu and at the end of the summer 2021 I worked in Kotikatu Oy, Espoo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Eurajoki and Pori I mainly mowed lawns and trimmed bushes. In Espoo I mainly cleaned yards of apartment buildings from trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the summers I learned to drive and operate different kinds of vehicles. For example, lawn mowers from Iseki, Grasshopper and Husqvarna; wheel loaders from Wille, Kubota and Caterpillar; and different sizes of vans and cars. I also learned what the work life is like in property maintenance work and the work ethics. Many kinds of tools also became familiar to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have done some short internships in supermarket (K-Supermarket, Tampere Villilä) and in a theatre (TTT). Also, when I was a child I was in two children's show in Pikkukakkonen. The shows were Taitoset and Lumiukko. The series are not visible on Yle Areena any more but here is a link to Taitoset Yle Areena webpage: <a href="https://areena.yle.fi/1-3822982">Taitoset</a>
