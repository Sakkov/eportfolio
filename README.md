# My ePortfolio
Website ePortfolio I made to learn some web developement and maybe help me stand out for posible employers.

The code is really messy because it's the first website I've done.

#### Update _10th of May_
I've been busy with my studies and work. I did a website for a customer which you can find here: https://kauvanto.fi. Now that I'm done with that project I may have time to do some small updates on my website.

#### Update _12th of April_
I moved the host from my local machine to Netlify. That means the website is up and running. I also got SSL certificate for the site. The address is https://sakukovanen.fi/

#### Update _1st of March_
I've been studying and working hard for January and February. Thus, there has not been any updates on my website. At the moment it is down since I just moved and I haven't had time to put the server up yet.

I am planning to add a record of the courses I have complited and the points I've gotten from the courses. I will be using the service "oma opintopolku". If you want to see them now here is the link: https://opintopolku.fi/koski/opinnot/3190049bd5e9497899937b761a380239
