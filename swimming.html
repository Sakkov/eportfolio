                Regular swimming has been hobby of mine ever since I was 2 years old. Competitive swimming, I started in 2009 in TaUs (Tampereen Uimaseura) as one of my good friends was in there. Later I changed to TaTU Tampere (Tampereen Työväen Uimarit).

                During my swimming years I learned the importance of scheduling, healthiness and of course how to work hard since at the most I had 7 workouts a week totalling of 14 hours of training.
